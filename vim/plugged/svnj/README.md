####Custom settings

    `let g:svnj_custom_statusbar_ops_hide = 1`
    
    Supported operations are listed on the status line of the svnj_window. With growing support for
    many commands, recomend to hide it. You can still have a quick glance of supported operations by
    pressing ? (question-mark)

####Cache settings

    `let g:svnj_browse_cache_all = 1`

    This enables caching, Listing of files will be faster, On MAC/Unix the default location is $HOME/.cache.
    A new directory svnj will be created in the specified directory.

    For windows this option must be specified along with the cache dir
        `let g:svnj_cache_dir="C:/Users/user1"`

####To list all branches or trunk

   Optional settings when available will provide menu's to navigate available branches/trunk

   `let g:svnj_branch_url = ["svn://127.0.0.1/Path/until/branches/", "svn://127.0.0.1/Path/until/tags"]`
